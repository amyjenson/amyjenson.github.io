       <h5>About me </h5>
    
    
   <p> I grew up in a tiny town on an island in Southeast Alaska.
       I went to University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau where I studied math. 
       During this time, I spent a semester on exchange in Trieste, Italy studying and traveling. 
       For the last three summers, I've commercial fished on the F/V Ruby as apart of a sustainable fishery in Bristol Bay.  
       In my spare time I like to ski, climb, hike, kayak, or make ceramics.
