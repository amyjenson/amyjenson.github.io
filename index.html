       A little about me: I grew up on an island in Southeast Alaska.
       I went to University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau where I studied math. 
       During this time, I spent a semester on exchange in Trieste, Italy studying and traveling. 
       For the last three summers, I've commercial fished in a sustainable fishery on the F/V Ruby in Bristol Bay.  
       In my spare time I like to ski, climb, hike, kayak, or make ceramics.
